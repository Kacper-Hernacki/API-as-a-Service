# DOCKER-DEMO

This repo was made for teaching full stack developers tha Docker technology. 

## Running app

Clone the repository and install dependencies for the project.

App itself is made as a simple node.js script, which will be just used for learning purposes.
Open terminal and in a project direstory, run:
```bash
node src/app.js
```

# Docker Commands Documentation

[Official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

## Introduction
This documentation provides a quick reference to basic Docker commands used in our project. It's designed to help developers quickly spin up, manage, and interact with Docker containers.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Docker commands and concepts.

## Basic Docker Commands

### 1. Starting Services with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up
```
This command starts all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

### 2. Listing Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
Use this to see all currently running containers.

### 3. Running a Container with Port Mapping
```bash
docker run -p 5001:8080 c9b19b0e6729
```
This command runs a container and maps port 8080 inside the container to port 5001 on the host machine.

### 4. Building a Docker Image with a Tag
```bash
docker build -t kacperher/docker-demo:1.1 .
```
This builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with a specific version.

### 5. Running a Container from an Image
```bash
docker run f6413f4104c8
```
This command creates and starts a container from the specified image.

### 6. Removing a Container
```bash
docker rm d8f60915f384
```
Use this command to remove a stopped container.

### 7. Listing All Containers (Running and Stopped)
```bash
docker ps -a
```
This shows all containers, including those that are not currently running.

### 8. Running a Specific Container
```bash
docker run c9b19b0e6729
```
This starts a container based on the specified image ID.

# Docker Desktop Handbook

## What is Docker Desktop?
Docker Desktop is an integrated development environment (IDE) for building, sharing, and running containerized applications and microservices. It's designed to streamline Docker workflows, offering a user-friendly interface and compatibility with multiple platforms.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install Docker Desktop on your machine:

### For Windows
1. **Download:** Go to the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page and download the installer.
2. **Install:** Double-click the installer file and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. **Run:** After installation, run Docker Desktop from the Start menu.

### For macOS
1. **Download:** Visit the [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page to download the installer.
2. **Install:** Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to the Applications folder.
3. **Run:** Open Docker from the Applications folder.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to get started with Docker Desktop:

### Running a Container
- **Open Docker Desktop:** Ensure Docker is running on your system.
- **Open Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows):** Run Docker commands here.
- **Example Command:** To run a simple Hello World container, type:

```bash
  docker run hello-world
```

# Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Configuration

### Overview
In this project, we use Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating and managing our containerized Node.js application. The configurations for K8s are organized in a dedicated directory to maintain a clear structure and ease of navigation.

### Directory Structure
- **`/k8s` Directory:**
    - This directory contains all the necessary Kubernetes YAML files for deploying our application. It includes configurations for various K8s resources such as Deployments, Services, and Ingresses.

### Files Description
- **`deployment.yaml`:**
    - Defines how our Node.js application is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. It specifies the Docker image to use, the number of replicas, and other deployment settings.
- **`service.yaml`:**
    - Contains the configuration for exposing our Node.js application to the outside world or within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Additional files, such as `ingress.yaml`, `configmap.yaml`, or `secret.yaml`, may also be present depending on the specific needs of our deployment.

### Usage
- To deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster, navigate to the `k8s` directory and run the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f . 
```
This command will apply all the Kubernetes configurations located in the k8s directory.

### Note
These files are meant to be used by developers who are familiar with Kubernetes operations. Please ensure you understand the configurations and modify them according to your deployment environment.

For more detailed information on each configuration file and its purpose, please refer to the individual file documentation inside the k8s directory.

# Docker Commands Documentation
[Official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

## Introduction
This documentation provides a quick reference to basic Docker commands used in our project. It's designed to help developers quickly spin up, manage, and interact with Docker containers.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Docker commands and concepts.

## Basic Docker Commands

### 1. Starting Services with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up
```
This command starts all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

### 2. Listing Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
Use this to see all currently running containers.

### 3. Running a Container with Port Mapping
```bash
docker run -p 5001:8080 c9b19b0e6729
```
This command runs a container and maps port 8080 inside the container to port 5001 on the host machine.

### 4. Building a Docker Image with a Tag
```bash
docker build -t kacperher/docker-demo:1.1 .
```
This builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with a specific version.

### 5. Running a Container from an Image
```bash
docker run f6413f4104c8
```
This command creates and starts a container from the specified image.

### 6. Removing a Container
```bash
docker rm d8f60915f384
```
Use this command to remove a stopped container.

### 7. Listing All Containers (Running and Stopped)
```bash
docker ps -a
```
This shows all containers, including those that are not currently running.

### 8. Running a Specific Container
```bash
docker run c9b19b0e6729
```
This starts a container based on the specified image ID.
